RSS-CSS-Selectors

In this task, we will create a trainer for learning CSS selectors. 
The trainer consists of multiple game levels. 
Each level includes a layout example and HTML code that corresponds to the current level. 
Some elements of the layout are highlighted using animation. 
The user's task is to write a CSS selector that targets all the highlighted elements in the layout.
